  # Acfs SingletonResources
  #
  # Usage explanation:
  #   Single.find      => sends GET    request to http://service:port/single
  #   my_single.save   => sends POST   request to http://service:port/single if my_single is a new object
  #                    or sends PUT    request to http://service:port/single if my_single has been requested before
  #   my_single.delete => sends DELETE request to http://service:port/single
  #
  # SingletonResources do not support the Resource method :all, since
  # always only a single instance of the resource is being returned
  #
